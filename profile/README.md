## Workspace Organization

In workspace we create and develop opensource projects for the community, mostly figma designs, JavaScript and TypeScript code. We are a community created by [Adobly](https://adobly.github.io/discord), a support company to get started in the programming world.

### Workspace on GitHub

In workspace we have a general project, which you can find in the "[Projects](https://github.com/orgs/workspaceproj/projects)" section of GitHub. And each code or design within the organization has a label that indicates if a project is official, if it is copyrighted or not, and if it is supported. There is also another label that indicates if a project will no longer be worked on or is obsolete.

| Label | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| ![Official](https://img.shields.io/badge/Official%20Project-DC2626) | Official projects are those that are made by Workspace, and that have its license. This applies to projects such as codes or designs of all kinds. If you find a Workspace project without this label, it may indicate that it is modified or not verified. |
| ![WithCopy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Copyright-16A34A) | Projects with a copyright label indicate that only members of the organization may use it, or it is copyrighted. If you wish to use any copyrighted code, you can open a ticket on the official Adobly server in the "Copyright" category. | 
| ![Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support-F59E0B) | The "Support" badge means that these projects are supported by the administrative team. On the other hand, projects that do not have this badge are only supported by the server support team. | 
| ![Obsolete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Obsolete-64748B) | The "Obsolete" badge indicates that this project will no longer work, will remain buggy, and/or will not receive updates. |

### Recommended downloads
From Workspace, we recommend that you always download the projects in the "latest" or "standard" versions, since the "pre-release" or "beta" versions may contain some bugs.  

That is, if there is a project with the versions: **Pre-release 1.0.2.35**, **Release 1.0.2** or **Beta 1.0.3**, download the **Release 1.0.2**, it is the stable version, and without errors. (This applies to any project of any kind.)  

If you have any questions or suggestions, do not hesitate to let us know on the official [Adobly server](https://adobly.github.io/discord).

### Contributing to the projects
If you wish to help or contribute something to the projects, I recommend that you do the following steps:
  1. Read the contribution rules for each repository, or for the general repository.
  2. Fork or clone the repository.
  3. Open a Pull Request.
  4. Comment your changes a bit.
  5. Wait for a response from the repository owner.

If you have any doubt or report, comment it on the official [Adobly server](https://adobly.github.io/discord).

### How to report issues
If you want to report a bug you have found, we ask you to go to the [Adobly server](https://adobly.github.io/discord), and in the help and doubts channel write your problem, we will be happy to answer you.
